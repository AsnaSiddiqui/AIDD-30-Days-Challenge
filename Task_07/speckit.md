# Speckit Plus

## What is Speckit Plus?

Speckit Plus is a structured system for creating AI-driven applications using a step-by-step workflow.
It helps developers think clearly, reduce mistakes, and follow a clean process instead of random coding. Overall, it turns messy development into an organized and predictable process.

## Core Concepts of Speckit Plus

### 1. /constitution

The Constitution phase sets the foundation of a system.
It defines the purpose, the problem being solved, the target audience, and the rules or constraints of the project.
This phase provides clarity before any technical work begins.

### 2. /specify

The Specify phase turns ideas into clear and detailed instructions.
It defines exact inputs, outputs, behaviors, and success criteria.
This stage removes confusion and makes the problem fully precise for development.

### 3. /plan

The Plan phase breaks the solution into logical structures and components.
It outlines workflows, data flow, and how different parts of the system will interact.
This phase serves as the architectural blueprint of the entire system.

### 4. /tasks

he Tasks phase converts the plan into small, actionable steps.
Each task is focused and easy for an AI agent to execute.
This phase ensures smooth and predictable implementation.

### 5. /implement

The Implement phase is where the actual code is generated and executed by the AI agent.
This stage follows the specifications, plan, and tasks to produce the final working solution.
It turns the designed system into a real, functional output.
